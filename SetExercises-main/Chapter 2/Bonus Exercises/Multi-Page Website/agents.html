    <h1 id="agents" class="subheads">THE AGENTS</h1> <br>
    <p class="paras">
        The agents are the characters in the game we control to play. Each agent has his/her
        own background story. Everyone has special abilities and powers that make each of them
        unique. <br><br>
        The game is more than just about guns. This is the list of agents in the game.

        ROLE: Duelist <br>
        Hailing from the U.K., Phoenix's star power shines through in his fighting style,

        3. SAGE <br>
        ROLE: Sentinel <br>
        The stronghold of China, Sage creates safety for herself and her team wherever she

        <br><br>
        4. SOVA <br>
        ROLE: Initiator <br>
        Born from the eternal winter of Russia's tundra, Sova tracks, finds, and eliminates

        5. VIPER <br>
        ROLE: Controller <br>
        The American chemist, Viper deploys an array of poisonous chemical devices to control
        the battlefield and cripple the enemy's vision. If the toxins don't kill her prey,

        ROLE: Sentinel <br>
        The Moroccan information broker, Cypher is a one-man surveillance network who keeps

        ROLE: Duelist <br>
        Forged in the heart of Mexico, Reyna dominates single combat, popping off with each

        ROLE: Sentinel <br>
        The genius of Germany. Killjoy secures the battlefield with ease using her arsenal

        ROLE: Initiator <br>

        ROLE: Controller <br>
        A phantom of a memory, Omen hunts in the shadows. He renders enemies blind, teleports

        might strike next.
        <br><br>
        11. JETT <br>
        ROLE: Duelist <br>
        Representing her home country of South Korea, Jett's agile and evasive fighting style

        ROLE: Initiator <br>
        Hailing from Australia, Skye and her band of beasts trail-blaze the way through hostile

        ROLE: Duelist <br>
        Filipino Agent Neon surges forward at shocking speeds, discharging bursts of bioelectric

        ROLE: Controller <br>
        Hailing from India’s coast, Harbor storms the field wielding ancient technology with

        allies and pummel those that oppose him.
        <br><br>
        21. GEKKO <br>
        ROLE: Initiator <br>
        Gekko the Angeleno leads a tight-knit crew of calamitous creatures. His buddies bound
