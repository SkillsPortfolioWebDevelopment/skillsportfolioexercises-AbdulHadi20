        Getting better every patch, they are doing a great job with this game. Great Free2Play,
        very fun and addicting. Can't help but compare it to CS but at the same time its very
        easy to enjoy it for what makes it different. The game feels very fair, i dont feel
        any of my deaths were unfair, over 10 months playing. At this point Valorant is an
        easy favorite and assuming the team will continue to patch, balance and update the
        game i dont see it leaving my favorite list any time soon.

        I like valorant. I like CSGO more but it gives it some competition. Some of the things
        I don't like are how every map is defensive sided with possibly the exception of
        ascent. I remember when they said the game wasn't gonna be trap and ability reliable
        but you add killjoy which is going to call for more support ops. I feel like in coming
        acts, hopefully, the ranked feature is fixed and SBM is a thing. I scared for the
        future of this game.

        This is a really good game! I love the different characters and how the game mechanics
        work. Seriously you should play it if you're not doing so already. The abilities are
        also really cool. My only suggestion is to maybe add a choice to join a game in
        progress that way you wont get punished for your internet going down.
