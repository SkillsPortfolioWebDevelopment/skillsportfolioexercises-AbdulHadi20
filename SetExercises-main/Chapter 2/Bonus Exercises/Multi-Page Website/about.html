        Straight from the files of Brimstone, this is the VALORANT Beginner’s Guide.
        Whether this is your first rotation or you're needing a refresher, we figure
        it’s best you take it from the Agent who’s seen it all before. Below is what
        to know before your first game. Pay attention. Might learn something.
        <br><br><br>
        1. Each game consists of 13 rounds. The team with most round wins claims victory.
        <br><br>
        2. You live once in each round.
        <br><br>
        3. Attackers push to plant the spike.
        <br><br>
        4. Defenders stop the attackers and difuse the spike before it blows up everything.
        <br><br><br>
        Before you enter your first round, you get to pick from a group of Agents, each
        with their own role and special skills designed to work alongside each other
        toward a win. After everyone selects their Agent (oh, you picked that one), you’ll jump into a
        random map and formally enter the first round. Start a round as either attacker
        or defender and switch sides in between. Before you do either, you’ll need to
        navigate the buy phase, which lets you purchase weapons and abilities. What you
        buy shapes how you can win. Let style or matchups guide your choices.
        No one’s going to tell you how to spend your money, but you’re going to have to
        pull the trigger at some point.
        <br><br><br>
        There’s a gun for every situation. When in doubt, try buying based on a weapon’s
        type and see how it fits your style, expertise, and your team’s strategy.
        When in doubt, try buying based on a weapon’s type and see how it fits your style,
        expertise, and your team’s strategy. Yeah, you might already know how to frag an
        enemy six ways from Sunday, but Brimstone will tell you, most of those ways are
        pretty noisy.
        <br><br><br>
        No more doubts, you’re ready. But like you, we’re just getting started. We’ll keep
        you updated on the latest Agents, Maps, and more...
