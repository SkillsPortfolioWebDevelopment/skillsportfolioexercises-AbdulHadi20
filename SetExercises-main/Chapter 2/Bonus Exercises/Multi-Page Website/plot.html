        VALORANT takes place on a version of Earth in the near future following an event
        known as First Light. This event spans the entire globe, leading to big
        transformations to life, technology, and how governments operate. However, select
        people across the globe start to gain abilities stemming from this massive event.
        These gifted individuals are called Radiants. In response to First Light, a shadow
        organization founds the VALORANT Protocol, which pulls together agents from all
        over the world. These Agents consist of Radiants and other individuals equipped
        with Radiant technology. Due to the backstories of these characters, the VALORANT
        team features interesting dynamics as the individuals not only sometimes know each
        other, but they also come from a wide spectrum of backgrounds ranging from crime to
        the military.
