        Straight from the files of Brimstone, this is the VALORANT Beginner’s Guide.
        Whether this is your first rotation or you're needing a refresher, we figure
        it’s best you take it from the Agent who’s seen it all before. Below is what
        to know before your first game. Pay attention. Might learn something.
        <br><br><br>
        1. Each game consists of 13 rounds. The team with most round wins claims victory.
        <br><br>
        2. You live once in each round.
        <br><br>
        3. Attackers push to plant the spike.
        <br><br>
        4. Defenders stop the attackers and difuse the spike before it blows up everything.
        <br><br><br>
        Before you enter your first round, you get to pick from a group of Agents, each
        with their own role and special skills designed to work alongside each other
        toward a win. After everyone selects their Agent (oh, you picked that one), you’ll jump into a
        random map and formally enter the first round. Start a round as either attacker
        or defender and switch sides in between. Before you do either, you’ll need to
        navigate the buy phase, which lets you purchase weapons and abilities. What you
        buy shapes how you can win. Let style or matchups guide your choices.
        No one’s going to tell you how to spend your money, but you’re going to have to
        pull the trigger at some point.
        <br><br><br>
        There’s a gun for every situation. When in doubt, try buying based on a weapon’s
        type and see how it fits your style, expertise, and your team’s strategy.
        When in doubt, try buying based on a weapon’s type and see how it fits your style,
        expertise, and your team’s strategy. Yeah, you might already know how to frag an
        enemy six ways from Sunday, but Brimstone will tell you, most of those ways are
        pretty noisy.
        <br><br><br>
        No more doubts, you’re ready. But like you, we’re just getting started. We’ll keep
        you updated on the latest Agents, Maps, and more...

    <h1 id="plot" class="subheads">THE PLOT</h1> <br>
    <p class="paras">
        VALORANT takes place on a version of Earth in the near future following an event
        known as First Light. This event spans the entire globe, leading to big
        transformations to life, technology, and how governments operate. However, select
        people across the globe start to gain abilities stemming from this massive event.
        These gifted individuals are called Radiants. In response to First Light, a shadow
        organization founds the VALORANT Protocol, which pulls together agents from all
        over the world. These Agents consist of Radiants and other individuals equipped
        with Radiant technology. Due to the backstories of these characters, the VALORANT
        team features interesting dynamics as the individuals not only sometimes know each
        other, but they also come from a wide spectrum of backgrounds ranging from crime to
        the military.

    <h1 id="agents" class="subheads">THE AGENTS</h1> <br>
    <p class="paras">
        The agents are the characters in the game we control to play. Each agent has his/her
        own background story. Everyone has special abilities and powers that make each of them
        unique. <br><br>
        The game is more than just about guns. This is the list of agents in the game.
        <br><br>

        1. BRIMSTONE <br>
        ROLE: Controller <br>
        Joining from the USA, Brimstone's orbital arsenal ensures his squad always has the
        advantage. His ability to deliver utility precisely and from a distance makes him
        an unmatched boots-on-the-ground commander.
        <br><br>
        2. PHOENIX <br>
        ROLE: Duelist <br>
        Hailing from the U.K., Phoenix's star power shines through in his fighting style,
        igniting the battlefield with flash and flare. Whether he's got backup or not,
        he'll rush into a fight on his own terms.
        <br><br>
        3. SAGE <br>
        ROLE: Sentinel <br>
        The stronghold of China, Sage creates safety for herself and her team wherever she
        goes. Able to revive fallen friends and stave off aggressive pushes, she provides
        a calm center to a hellish fight.
        <br><br>
        4. SOVA <br>
        ROLE: Initiator <br>
        Born from the eternal winter of Russia's tundra, Sova tracks, finds, and eliminates
        enemies with ruthless efficiency and precision. His custom bow and incredible
        scouting abilities ensure that even if you run, you cannot hide.
        <br><br>
        5. VIPER <br>
        ROLE: Controller <br>
        The American chemist, Viper deploys an array of poisonous chemical devices to control
        the battlefield and cripple the enemy's vision. If the toxins don't kill her prey,
        her mind games surely will.
        <br><br>
        6. CYPHER <br>
        ROLE: Sentinel <br>
        The Moroccan information broker, Cypher is a one-man surveillance network who keeps
        tabs on the enemy's every move. No secret is safe. No maneuver goes unseen. Cypher is
        always watching.
        <br><br>
        7. REYNA <br>
        ROLE: Duelist <br>
        Forged in the heart of Mexico, Reyna dominates single combat, popping off with each
        kill she scores. Her capability is only limited by her raw skill, making her highly
        dependent on performance.
        <br><br>
        8. KILLJOY <br>
        ROLE: Sentinel <br>
        The genius of Germany. Killjoy secures the battlefield with ease using her arsenal
        of inventions. If the damage from her gear doesn't stop her enemies, her robots' debuff
        will help make short work of them.
        <br><br>
        9. BREACH <br>
        ROLE: Initiator <br>
        Breach, the bionic Swede, fires powerful, targeted kinetic blasts to aggressively clear
        a path through enemy ground. The damage and disruption he inflicts ensures no fight is
        ever fair.
        <br><br>
        10. OMEN <br>
        ROLE: Controller <br>
        A phantom of a memory, Omen hunts in the shadows. He renders enemies blind, teleports
        across the field, then lets paranoia take hold as his foe scrambles to learn where he
        might strike next.
        <br><br>
        11. JETT <br>
        ROLE: Duelist <br>
        Representing her home country of South Korea, Jett's agile and evasive fighting style
        lets her take risks no one else can. She runs circles around every skirmish, cutting
        enemies before they even know what hit them.
        <br><br>
        12. RAZE <br>
        ROLE: Duelist <br>
        Raze explodes out of Brazil with her big personality and big guns. With her
        blunt-force-trauma playstyle, she excels at flushing entrenched enemies and clearing
        tight spaces with a generous dose of “boom.”
        <br><br>
        13. SKYE <br>
        ROLE: Initiator <br>
        Hailing from Australia, Skye and her band of beasts trail-blaze the way through hostile
        territory. With her creations hampering the enemy, and her power to heal others, the
        team is strongest and safest by Skye’s side.
        <br><br>
        14. YORU <br>
        ROLE: Duelist <br>
        Japanese native, Yoru, rips holes straight through reality to infiltrate enemy lines
        unseen. Using deception and aggression in equal measure, he gets the drop on each
        target before they know where to look.
        <br><br>
        15. ASTRA <br>
        ROLE: Controller <br>
        Ghanaian Agent Astra harnesses the energies of the cosmos to reshape battlefields to
        her whim. With full command of her astral form and a talent for deep strategic
        foresight, she's always eons ahead of her enemy's next move.
        <br><br>
        16. KAY/O <br>
        ROLE: Initiator <br>
        KAY/O is a machine of war built for a single purpose: neutralizing radiants. His power
        to suppress enemy abilities cripples his opponents' capacity to fight back, securing
        him and his allies the ultimate edge.
        <br><br>
        17. CHAMBER <br>
        ROLE: Sentinel <br>
        Well dressed and well armed, French weapons designer Chamber expels aggressors with
        deadly precision. He leverages his custom arsenal to hold the line and pick off
        enemies from afar, with a contingency built for every plan.
        <br><br>
        18. NEON <br>
        ROLE: Duelist <br>
        Filipino Agent Neon surges forward at shocking speeds, discharging bursts of bioelectric
        radiance as fast as her body generates it. She races ahead to catch enemies off guard,
        then strikes them down quicker than lightning.
        <br><br>
        19. FADE <br>
        ROLE: Initiator <br>
        Turkish bounty hunter, Fade, unleashes the power of raw nightmares to seize enemy secrets.
        Attuned with terror itself, she hunts targets and reveals their deepest fears—before
        crushing them in the dark.
        <br><br>
        20. HARBOUR <br>
        ROLE: Controller <br>
        Hailing from India’s coast, Harbor storms the field wielding ancient technology with
        dominion over water. He unleashes frothing rapids and crushing waves to shield his
        allies and pummel those that oppose him.
        <br><br>
        21. GEKKO <br>
        ROLE: Initiator <br>
        Gekko the Angeleno leads a tight-knit crew of calamitous creatures. His buddies bound
        forward, scattering enemies out of the way, with Gekko chasing them down to regroup
        and go again.

        Getting better every patch, they are doing a great job with this game. Great Free2Play,
        very fun and addicting. Can't help but compare it to CS but at the same time its very
        easy to enjoy it for what makes it different. The game feels very fair, i dont feel
        any of my deaths were unfair, over 10 months playing. At this point Valorant is an
        easy favorite and assuming the team will continue to patch, balance and update the
        game i dont see it leaving my favorite list any time soon.

        I like valorant. I like CSGO more but it gives it some competition. Some of the things
        I don't like are how every map is defensive sided with possibly the exception of
        ascent. I remember when they said the game wasn't gonna be trap and ability reliable
        but you add killjoy which is going to call for more support ops. I feel like in coming
        acts, hopefully, the ranked feature is fixed and SBM is a thing. I scared for the
        future of this game.

        This is a really good game! I love the different characters and how the game mechanics
        work. Seriously you should play it if you're not doing so already. The abilities are
        also really cool. My only suggestion is to maybe add a choice to join a game in
        progress that way you wont get punished for your internet going down.
