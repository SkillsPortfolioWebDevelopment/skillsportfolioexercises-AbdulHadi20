        HTML stands for HyperTextMarkupLanguage. It is used to build the skeletal structure
        of the websites. Every HTML tag is written inside <> brackets. Closing tags include
            a '/' with the name of the tag. Here is the reference guide for the basic tags:
    </p>
    <br>
    <table class="firstone">
        <tr>
            <th>The Tag</th>

                < html>
            </td>
            <td>
                This is the root element of the document. It converts the text documents
                into webpages. It also indicates the begining and the end of the document.

                The title tag displays its contents on the title bar of a web browser. It
                is essential to give accurate titles to websites/webpages for better results
                in SEOs and SERP.

                webpage. The h1 is the largest of them all. Then onwards each heading gets
